### TASK
Letâ€™s say we want to build a model to predict booking prices on Airbnb. Between linear regression and random forest regression, which model would perform better and why?

### Answer.
 Random forest regression is likely to perform better than linear regression for predicting booking prices on Airbnb. This is because;
 
     1. Random forest regression is a non-parametric model, so it does not make any assumptions about the underlying relationships between the variables in the data.
     
     2. Random forest regression is well-suited to modeling complex relationships.
     
     3. Random forest regression is easier to interpret than other machine learning models.
